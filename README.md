# Jest Chrome Faker


## Abstract

Jest Chrome Faker provides [working implementations](#implementations) of parts of the [Chrome API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/reference) (Web Extensions) for use in [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started): 

```js
import { fakeTabs } from 'jest-chrome-faker'
import { someTabFunction } from '@/services/tabs'

beforeAll (() => {
  fakeTabs([
    { url: 'https://linkedin.com' },
    { url: 'https://google.com' },
    ...
  ])
})

it('should search tabs', () => {
  someTabFunction('goo', tabs => {
    expect(tabs[0].url).toBe('https://google.com')
  })
})
```

Using fakes (or "[test doubles](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html)") makes it simple to programatically test parts of your extension code which rely heavily on the Chrome API, in a test environment, at speed, using stub data.

Martin Fowler [says](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/IntegrationTest.html#:~:text=it's%20likely%20to%20significantly%20improve%20your%20testing%20speed):

> [Integration Tests] are likely to significantly improve your testing speed, ease of use, and resiliency.
>
> Since they are limited in scope, they often run very fast, so can run in early stages of a deployment pipeline, providing faster feedback should they go red.

Whilst at this early stage of development there are some [limitations](#current-limitations), the implementations' [source code](src/api) is fully decoupled from the base mock setup, and is easy to review, test and commit updates to.

Check the [roadmap](#roadmap) for development plans.

## Setup

### Installation

Install the library and its peers via Yarn or NPM:

```sh
npm i -D jest-chrome-faker jest-chrome jest
```

### Setup

#### Jest

Configure Jest to call a setup file directly before each test: 

```js
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  ...
  setupFilesAfterEnv: [
    '<rootDir>/tests/setup/jest-chrome.js' // choose a path that works for you
  ]
}
```

Create the setup file as per your configuration, and add the following code:

```js
// jest-chrome.js
Object.assign(global, require('jest-chrome'))

require('jest-chrome-faker').setChrome(global.chrome)
```

#### Using Web Extension Polyfill

If you are using [webextension-polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) (or the TypeScript version of it) so you can use Mozilla's promise-based `browser.*` namespace in your application code, you will need to add the following lines:

```js
// fix to enable webextension-polyfill in test environment
chrome.runtime.id = 'test'

// inject webextension-polyfill's `browser` variable into the global namespace
Object.assign(global, require('webextension-polyfill-ts'))
```

*Note: the JS and TS versions differ in their named and default exports, so adjust accordingly.*

#### Further help

For further information, see the docs for the associated libraries:

- [Jest Chrome](https://github.com/extend-chrome/jest-chrome)
- [Web Extension Polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill)
- [Web Extension Polyfill for TypeScript](https://github.com/Lusito/webextension-polyfill-ts/)

## Usage

Generally, usage goes like this:

- import one or more `fake*` functions
- fake one or more APIs using dummy data you provide
- write and run your tests

Below is a fairly contrived example to demonstrate querying the API and using the generated data:

```ts
import { chrome } from 'jest-chrome'
import { browser } from 'webextension-polyfill-ts'
import { fakeTabs, fakeHistory } from 'jest-chrome-faker'

// stub data
const linkedIn = { url: 'http://linkedin.com', title: 'Linked In' }
const google = { url: 'http://google.com', title: 'Google' }
const msn = { url: 'http://msn.com', title: 'MSN' }

// tests
describe('integration', function () {

  beforeAll(async function () {
    fakeTabs([linkedIn, google, msn])
    fakeHistory([linkedIn, google, msn, msn, msn])
  })

  it('should query visit times based on tab title', async function () {
    const title = 'MSN'
    const tabs = await browser.tabs.query({ title })
    const url = tabs[0].url!
    const visits = await browser.history.getVisits({ url })
    const visitTimes = visits.map(visit => visit.visitTime)
    expect(visitTimes).toEqual([2000, 3000, 4000])
  })

})
```

The library aims to logically "fill in" missing data where it can.

As an example, the data returned from `history.getVisits()` is:

```js
[
  {
    id: '6',
    visitId: '9',
    referringVisitId: '0',
    visitTime: 2000,
    transition: 'link'
  },
  {
    id: '6',
    visitId: '10',
    referringVisitId: '0',
    visitTime: 3000,
    transition: 'link'
  },
  {
    id: '6',
    visitId: '11',
    referringVisitId: '0',
    visitTime: 4000,
    transition: 'link'
  }
]
```

As you can see, `id`s are unique and visit times are generated at 1-second intervals from the epoch.

See the [tests](tests/unit) folder for full examples for all available APIs.

## Project information

### How it works

The library is built on top of [Jest Chrome](https://github.com/extend-chrome/jest-chrome) which provides base mocks for the entire Chrome API:

```js
it('should have called query', function() {
  expect(chrome.tabs.query).toHaveBeenCalled()
})
```

Chrome Jest Faker builds on top of this and uses Jest's [mockImplementation()](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/22.x/mock-function-api#mockfnmockimplementationfn) to provide the actual functionality.

### Implementations

**Jest Chrome Faker promises "working implementations" â€“ but what does that mean?**

Understandably, the full functionality of a Google Chrome extension is not going to be available in a Node environment, but the library provides both implementations and a framework to ensure that working, faithful, implementations of core APIs can be faked to a reasonable level.

#### Areas

The areas the library needs to deliver on are:

- **APIs** - are the key APIs available, and can they be expected to behave faithfully? 
- **Data** - is the user able to stub initial state, and then have it update accordingly?
- **Methods** - are the key methods available, and do they update state as expected?
- **Events** - do the right events fire, at the right time, with the right payloads?
- **Errors** - does the library handle and report errors as per the real Extensions environment?
- **Integration** - do the disparate parts of the API interact, and if so, how do they update each other?  

#### Aims

The **base aim** for implementations is:

- to provide **minimal implementations** for core APIs ([History](https://github.com/likelylogic/jest-chrome-faker/issues/3), [Storage](https://github.com/likelylogic/jest-chrome-faker/issues/8), [Tabs](https://github.com/likelylogic/jest-chrome-faker/issues/9), etc)

A **minimal implementation** would:

- allow the user to easily provide initial state
- Have the framework fill in default values
- model and maintain state within the API as subsequent methods are called
- provide at least the main methods (specific to each API) so that basic integrations can be tested

A minimal implementation **would not** be guaranteed to:

- reproduce all properties and methods
- faithfully fire all events
- update related APIs
- report errors

#### Current limitations

What this means in practice is that individual implementations **will behave provide different levels of faithfulness** depending on how big or complex each API is, and whether the tradeoff for completeness is a reasonable one, given the work in involved.

For example, modifying a tab's URL:

- updates the data within the Tabs API
- fires an event
- but does not yet update History

Once the High Priority items have been completed, this will be the next area to look at. 

#### API parity

To ensure parity to the APIs it mocks, the plan it to set up some kind of [Contract Tests](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContractTest.html) to compare the output of the source code against the real Chrome API. 

### Roadmap

The APIs have been prioritised as follows:

- [High Priority](https://github.com/likelylogic/jest-chrome-faker/milestones/High%20Priority)
- [Low Priority](https://github.com/likelylogic/jest-chrome-fake/issues/1)

Individual APIs are logged as [issues](https://github.com/likelylogic/jest-chrome-faker/issues/labels/API) where you can go to see:

- progress on which properties, method and events have completed
- documentation links
- a [source](src/api) code link
- any notes

Note that as there are various non-testable APIs (for example, Tab Capture) it is likely that only a portion of the API will be fully faked.
